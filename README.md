# Recipe-App
 This project involves creating a small-scale online recipe management system where users can share, view, and comment on recipes. It will allow you to engage with a full-stack development task, including front-end, back-end, and database interactions.

Project: Online Recipe Management System

Overview:
Develop a web-based application where users can sign up, log in, share recipes, view recipes shared by others, and leave comments on recipes. The application should have a clean, intuitive interface and follow good security practices.

Features:

1. User Authentication:

Users can sign up with a username, email, and password.
Users can log in and log out.
Passwords should be securely hashed before being stored in the database.
Recipe Sharing:

Authenticated users can share recipes including title, ingredients, instructions, and an optional image.
Users can edit or delete their own recipes.

2. Recipe Viewing:

All visitors (authenticated and anonymous) can view the list of shared recipes.
Clicking on a recipe title takes the visitor to a page displaying the recipe details.

3. Commenting:

Authenticated users can leave comments on recipes.
Users can edit or delete their own comments.

4. Search Functionality:

Visitors can search for recipes based on keywords in the title or ingredients.
Responsive Design:

The application should have a responsive design to accommodate various screen sizes.

5. Admin Panel (optional advanced feature):

An admin panel where admins can manage users and recipes.
Admins can edit or delete any recipe or user.

6. Technical Requirements:

6.1 PHP: Server-side logic including user authentication, recipe, and comment management.

6.2 HTML/CSS: Structuring and styling the web pages.

6.3 JavaScript: Enhancing interactivity and user experience, possibly including AJAX for a smoother user experience.

6.4 MySQL: Storing user, recipe, and comment data.

6.5 Security: Implement security best practices to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery.

7. Evaluation Criteria:
7.1 Code Quality: Clean, readable, and well-organized code.
7.2 Functionality: All features work as expected.
7.3 Security: The application should be free from common security vulnerabilities.
7.4 Design: A user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface.
7.5 Responsiveness: The application should work well on various screen sizes and devices.

8. Extensions (for further challenge):
8.1 Implement an API to allow other applications to interact with your system.
8.2 Implement additional features such as recipe rating, categorization by cuisine or meal type, or a user profile section.

This challenge should provide a robust playground to hone your skills in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL while engaging in good security practices and database management. The inclusion of an optional advanced feature and extension tasks allows for further exploration and complexity should you wish to delve deeper.
